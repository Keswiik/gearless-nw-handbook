# Overview

{{% pageinfo %}}
We use open comms, but if you are consistently disruptive, you'll be server muted.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Everyone attending war will join the "Node War Offense" channel in discord. Anyone in special teams can deafen after pre-war.

All special teams will join the our Teamspeak server and hop into their respective channels.

## Cross-Team Comms
Either a team lead, or someone appointed by a team lead, will make themselves a "Channel Commander" in Teamspeak. Anyone in teamspeak with this role can talk _between_ channels, which allows special teams to relay information without all the excess chatter.

{{%expand "How to check if you have Channel Commander" %}}
You call tell if you're a channel commander by looking at the icon next to your name in Teamspeak - if it's yellow, you can use it.

![Channel Commander Example](/gearless-nw-handbook/TS3_Channel_Commander.png)

<br>
If you are not a channel commander and need cross-comms access, right-click on your name and click the "Channel Commander" option.

![Channel Commander Context Menu](/gearless-nw-handbook/TS3_CC_Context_Menu.png)

<br>
If this option doesn't appear, or you can't click it, ask someone in leadership to give you perms in Teamspeak.

## Hotkeys

Hotkeys will differ depending on whether or not you primarily talk in Teamspeak (special teams) or discord (main ball).

### Changing Discord Hotkeys
Click on `Settings` > `Keybinds`, and then ![Add a Hotkey](/gearless-nw-handbook/Discord_Add_Keybinds_Button.png).

### Changing Teamspeak Hotkeys
Click on `Tools` > `Options` > `Hotkeys`, and then ![Add](/gearless-nw-handbook/TS3_Add_Hotkey_Button.png) a new hotkey.  
Click on ![Show Advanced Actions](/gearless-nw-handbook/TS3_Advanced_Hotkeys_Button.png) to show the full list of options.
