Caps are based on your overall stats (after buffs, passives, etc). Human Damage can be used to meet AP caps, but does _not_ let you bypass the cap.

You can view how your current stats compare to caps by opening the map, turning on Node War Information (crossed swords icon), and hovering over a node.
