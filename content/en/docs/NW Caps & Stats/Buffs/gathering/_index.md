Some buffs require mats that are rare and are always sold out on the CM. If you want them, you'll have to learn to gather the mats and craft them yourself.  

## Elixir of Detection
This is the hardest to acquire elixir because it requires Truffle Mushrooms which only spawn in secret unmarked caves around the map.  
It's also one of the most important elixirs.

1250+ gathering mastery is recommended if you do this. If you're only getting 1 truffle per gather then you're wasting your time.

[Here's a guide for truffle mushroom locations](https://grumpygreen.cricket/truffle-mushroom/).

## Fruits of X
You get these through farming. Master+ farming is ideal, but you'll get them at any level.  
<br>
If you're not familiar with farming, you'll want to rent 10x10 farming plots and work your way up to having all magical seeds of the crop you choose to farm. This will require 100CP.  
<br>
At higher farming masteries, you'll also have a chance to get a "Mysterious Seed", which can give 30+ Fruit when bred.

The South-Western exit of Velia, near Eileen and Dalishain, is an ideal spot for farming plots.
