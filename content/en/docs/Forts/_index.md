## Placing Forts
1. Buy a fort for the appropriate node tier from the guild War Supplies vendor of your choice.
2. Open the map
3. Click on the node you want to place a fort on, select "Yes" in the prompt that follows.
4. Navigate to wherever you want to drop your fort.
5. Select the correct fort from the window on the left-hand side of your screen.
6. Click on the ground and confirm your placement.
7. Click the "Install" button below the window on the left-hand side of your screen.

### Building
Building is pretty situational, but here are some general guidelines.

**DON'T**:
- Place a fort next to easily exploited terrain (large rocks, hills, structures, etc - its easy for casters to sit on these and do free damage to your base)
- **PLACE NEAR SAFE ZONES**
- Place right on the edge of the NW zone. It can result in people standing outside of the area and using safezone spawn.

**DO**:
- Place at least 200 units from the edge of zone.
- Place on flat terrain if there are no advantageous fort locations available
- Place on elevated terrain with chokes
- Place far away from safe zones.

### Scouting Nodes
Scouting is kind of counter-intuitive. In order to do this, you'll:
1. Have a fort of the **WRONG** tier in your inventory.
2. Follow the same procedure as placing a fort (except for step 6, as it won't let you install)
3. Check for error message stating other forts are too close to the location you chose.

By doing this, you can repeatedly try to "build" your fort and figure out what general areas people are located in.  
This can be helpful when:
- A node is highly contested and you want to figure out what locations are available.
- You want to figure out roughly how many people are on the node.
- You want to be a scumbag and start outside of node to blitz someone's base before they can load in.

## Fort Repair
It takes 40 seconds by default to repair your fort. This can be reduced by leveling up **ANY** lifeskill. The higher the level, the larger the reduction in tap time.  
**20 seconds is the fastest repair time**.

### NW
You'll need either ![Polished Stone](/gearless-nw-handbook/items/Polished_Stone.png) Polished Stone or ![Impeccably Polished Stone](/gearless-nw-handbook/items/Impeccably_Polished_Stone.png) Impeccably Polished Stone.  
Either works, **BUT IF YOU'RE NOT USING IMPECCABLY POLISHED STONE THEN YOU'RE GRIEFING YOUR GUILD**.

You can craft it by heating:  
![Polished Stone](/gearless-nw-handbook/items/Rough_Stone.png) Polished Stone x10  
![Rough Translucent Crystal](/gearless-nw-handbook/items/Rough_Translucent_Crystal.png) Rough Translucent Crystal x5  
![Clear Liquid Reagent](/gearless-nw-handbook/items/Clear_Liquid_Reagent.png) Clear Liquid Reagent x1  

{{% expand "Gathering Required Mats" %}}
![Rough Translucent Crystal](/gearless-nw-handbook/items/Rough_Translucent_Crystal.png) can be obtained from the CM or by assigning workers to Goblin Cave.  
![Clear Liquid Reagent](/gearless-nw-handbook/items/Clear_Liquid_Reagent.png) is always on the CM, buy it and don't waste your time.  
![Polished Stone](/gearless-nw-handbook/items/Polished_Stone.png) must be crafted. You'll need to gather ![Rough Stone](/gearless-nw-handbook/items/Rough_Stone.png) Rough Stone.  
<br>
The most efficient place to gather rough stone is Pilgrim's Haven, a node northeast of Sand Grain Bazaar.  
![Pilgrim's Haven](/gearless-nw-handbook/Pilgrims_Haven.jpg)  
<br>
Around it you'll find piles of stone, and you can gather from each pile multiple times.  
**MAKE SURE YOU USE AGRIS WHEN GATHERING, YOU'LL WASTE LESS TIME HERE.**
